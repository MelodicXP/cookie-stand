### **Reflections and Comments**

### Class 07 - Constructors

    * I learned how to set id for elements in JavaScript
    * Remember when using global variables you don't have to use 'this' keyword.
    * Learned how to create a table in JavaScript
    * What works for me is create the basic funtionality first and then wrap what I need in function or method
    * Remember you can use global variables to be used as data storage within functions.  

### Class 06 - Objects

    * Nuances I learned so far is that when pushing to an array, you can call a function/method within the push call, and even call a function within a function.
    * Using placeholders for temporary values really assist in solving for a desired output.
